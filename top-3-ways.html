            Top 3 ways to be a healthy programmer!
        </h1>
        <p>
            For whatever reason we may love about it, programming can be bad for your health if we don't take few
            necessary
            steps. Developers face a lot of physical and mental health challenges in today’s world. It can be any one of  wrist
            or
            back pain, eye strain, feeling low, or trouble focusing while programming.

            Here are <strong>3 easy ways</strong> to take care of yourself and keep your mind and body healthy:
        </p>


        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Go out on a walk !</strong>
                <p>
                    There's a new phrase going around that sitting is the new smoking. We’ve probably all sat in front
                    of our
                    computer screens for hours at a time. It’s creating our back problems, straining our eyes, and
                    draining our energy levels, and it’s probably why we get headaches.

                    So take a walk instead! It helps regulate the nervous system, as well as our mood. In addition to
                    the many health benefits, <strong>walking for 20 minutes</strong> will burn an average of 70–140 calories(healthy for
                    our health). Best thing is , walking is a great way to prevent back pain!

            <li>
                <strong>The 20/20/20 rule! </strong>
                <p>
                    I got to know about this rule from my mentor <a href="https://tanaypratap.com/">Tanay Pratap</a>.
                    The rule is very simple: for every 20 minutes, look at something <strong>20 feet away, for 20 seconds</strong>. You can keep repeating it or can even increase the distance and duration. You can also look away for 30 seconds, or even a
                    minute!

                    You can also save yourself from dry eyes by just blinking!
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Start using Dark Mode !</strong>
                <p>
                   We all are surrounded by screens whether it's our laptop, mobile phones, TV, smart watch, etc. 
                   As we all know they all emit blue light, which is somewhat harmful to our eyes if exposed for a long time!
                   We can significantly decrease its effect if we start using blue-light filter or dark mode in every screen we use. Every moden day screen has this option in it. So dont forget to turn on your <strong>dark mode!</strong>
